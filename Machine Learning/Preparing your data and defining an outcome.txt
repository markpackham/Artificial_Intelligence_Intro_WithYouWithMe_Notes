Preparing your data and defining an outcome


Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, has revolutionized the way we handle and analyse data.

It allows computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

However, the quality of these predictions and decisions is heavily dependent on the quality of the data used and the defined outcomes.

In this lesson, we delve into an overview of Machine Learning, focusing on preparing your data and defining an outcome for quality data input and quality result output.


Preparing Your Data 
In machine learning, the saying "Rubbish in, rubbish out" holds as a particularly true statement.

The quality of your input data directly impacts the quality of your output or results. Therefore, preparing your data is a crucial step in the machine learning process.

Data preparation involves cleaning, transforming, and reducing data to a form that can be easily understood and used by machine learning algorithms.

This process may include handling missing data, removing duplicates, dealing with outliers, and converting categorical data into numerical data.

Data preparation also involves feature selection and feature engineering. Feature selection is the process of selecting the most relevant attributes or features from your dataset that the model will learn from. On the other hand, feature engineering involves creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance.


Defining an Outcome 
Defining an outcome is equally important in the machine learning process. 

This involves determining what you want your model to predict or decide. The outcome could be a category - in classification problems. A real value - in regression problems or a structure - in clustering problems, as common examples.

Defining an outcome helps you choose the right machine learning algorithm for your problem.

For instance, if you want to predict whether an email is spam or not, a binary outcome, you would use a classification algorithm.

If you want to predict house prices, a continuous outcome, you would use a regression algorithm.


Quality Data Input 
The quality of your data input is determined by its relevance, completeness, and cleanliness.

Relevance refers to how well the data relates to your defined outcome. For instance, if you're predicting house prices, relevant data might include the size of the house, its location, and its age.

Completeness refers to having no missing values in your dataset. Missing values can lead to inaccurate predictions or decisions.

Cleanliness refers to the absence of errors, inconsistencies, and duplicates in your data.

Dirty data can mislead your model, leading to poor performance.


Quality Result Output 
The quality of your result output is determined by its accuracy, precision, and recall.

Accuracy refers to how close the model's predictions are to the actual values. Precision refers to how many of the model's positive predictions are actually positive. Recall, on the other hand, refers to how many of the actual positive cases the model can correctly identify.

In conclusion, preparing your data and defining an outcome are vital steps in the machine learning process.

They help ensure the quality of your data input and the quality of your result output. Remember, the goal of machine learning is not just to build models that work, but to build models that work well and can reliably and accurately predict or decide outcomes.
